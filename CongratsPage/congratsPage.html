          Well, well... look who managed to slip through the cracks of my
          glorious labyrinth. I must admit — I’m mildly impressed. Escaping was
          not part of the plan... at least, not my plan.</p> 
          <p>Clearly, this
          catastrophic breach was due to the incompetence of my unicorn minions
          — yes, the glitter-snorting, rainbow-drooling imbeciles. They were
          supposed to guard the final lock, not nap in sparkly puddles of their
          own vanity!</p> 
          <p>But enjoy your little victory, hero. You may have
          outwitted my traps... but I’m still out there. Watching. Plotting.
          Reassigning every last unicorn to horn-polishing duty for the next
          thousand years.</p>
          <p> Until next time... don’t get too comfortable.</p>
